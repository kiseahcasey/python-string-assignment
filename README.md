# python-string-assignment
A Python program with menu-driven string operations like reverse, count vowels, palindrome check, and more.

# Short Description
This Python program lets users enter a sentence and choose from different string operations such as reversing, counting vowels, checking palindrome, replacing words, formatting in title case, splitting into words, counting word frequency, and swapping case. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

# Learning Experience
While solving this assignment, I learned:
- How to define and use functions in Python with `def`.
- Different string operations such as reverse, replace, and swap case.
- How to use loops (`while True`) to create a repeating menu system in Python.
- How to handle invalid choices gracefully.
- The usefulness of dictionaries for counting word frequency.
